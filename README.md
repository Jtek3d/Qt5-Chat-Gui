# Multi/os use gui, for openai chat bots
the plan i had with this:
   
   a useful chat bot usable on various devices. 
   on android its useful with the keyboard stt. working on that integration as well.
   have voice speech and speech to text in mind.
   right now it uses premade models.
   planing on integrating my own model when i get it's training to be more predictable. fun training a new model.
   
   features:
   :run on any os that runs os, it uses qt5.     -it has mutliple directions to go with the responeses some use libraries some are api's it's setting based
   :has presonality presets,      -different model's/temps. so on semi templated in the code. may move to seperate file soon
   :has a topic bar
   :has presets for the the topics
   :has temporary history
   
   :was designed for touch scrolling but it fights with the data selection
