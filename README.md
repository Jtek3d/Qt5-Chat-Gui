# Multi/os use gui, for openai chat bots
the plan i had with this:
   
   a useful chat bot usable on various devices. 
   on android its useful speech to text, using the android gboard text tool built in.
   working on that integration as well.
   have voice speech and speech to text in mind.
   right now it uses premade models.
   planing on integrating my own model when i get it's training to be more predictable. fun training a new model.
   
   features:
   :run on any os that runs os, it uses python qt5.  
   :easily runs on my linux, windows or android 
      prosibly even oculus being android based(hmm), 
      would have to clean the ui easily done tho 
   
   :generated text using the openai library or api, 
   :testing using alpaca, as well as one of the models i'm training.
